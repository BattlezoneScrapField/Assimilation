Well i don't have very many notes writen down so i'm not going to be able to explain it well enough for you right now.

This is where the animation keys begin,there are 3 of them
ie: Position,rotation and scale (0 2 1)
The first object,in this case the dummyroot it never saves a animation when exported.

AnimationSet {
Animation anim-dummyroot {
{frm-dummyroot}
}
(next object)
This starts the animation key for position key "0" the next line "90;" is the number of animation frames in that key.

Animation anim-idx11bda {
{frm-idx11bda}

SI_AnimationKey {
0;
90;
This next line is position key frame 0 (zero) it is composed of x,y,z coordinates and the forth is the angle i think.

0; 4; -0.109750, -0.622684, -0.335060, 0.698538;;,

Rotation key:
There are 3 sets of coordinates x,y and z the first key frame will start at the same coordinate of the 4th line of the Objects Transform matrix.

From that you can edit key frames to change rotation and position add or remove animation keys.

I have even rescaled a walker model's walk animation when 3ds max was too much of a pain to do it.

You can also change unanimated object's Position and scale by editing the TFM (Transform matrix)

I hope that tells you enough to get a idea how we do it.
