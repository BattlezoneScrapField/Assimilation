The Story: - 
The Scions used to be the biggest threat, they came out of nowhere on Pluto and decided to clam the universe for themselves. I mean, what else do they want, the universe is big for everyone. But we fought and we made them turn tail and run.

This was many years ago, and we have not heard anything from them since, in fact it has been a little peaceful, and life at the ISDF has never been so calm.

Sure there have been rumours of something going on, but that's what everybody thought, just rumours and gossip. Children's tails to make them sleep and do what there parents say. 

No one knew that a group of scientist where planning there next big experiment. Something to do with compressing the next boson partial into a matter stream to open a gateway to other parts of space to improve space travel for our new fleet of ships that the scion war has happily helped us to make.

There was the fighting side of the war, but there also was the studying side. The Scions really never posed a threat. The truth was hidden from everybody and they just wanted an excuse to use the war to keep money and funds poring into the project. Like in the mid 20th century, new people would make a new fuel source, but the big oil companies just bought the plans to keep people buying the fuel, this was no different, they made the war as it is, so they can keep money coming in for their tests and fame.

This travel will change everything in the universe. The race that has this technology will have the power, which was there goal. Me? They call me Cameron, Nothing much, I signed on the ISDF about 1 year ago, I had no job and was looking for adventure, Commander is a job I would like to be, and chances of getting that far is slim, only action will see people like me taking the chance to be commander. War brings out the best in people. The Scion war made pilots into commanders so easily you would have thought they came from a factory. But that fame is short lived, a few heavy units and the base is gone.

Me, I was lucky, I heard about the war, so I escaped that and I am still here to live. But far from the truth I know there will be a serous battle, and the basic resource of all.... Scrap... That is getting harder to find. We all thought that scrap is easy to find, but a scientist said that scrap is a natural resource created when the universe was made. How this happened and how it changed the way life goes we do not know. But a scientist and technician found a way to make a subastute. It looks the same as scrap and acts the same... But it requires a lot of power and a refinery on base to make it. We call it Scap still, but it makes the use of scavenger useless.

Materials have to be transported in from all over the sector and dropped of in pods, then the commander will tug the pod to base and make scrap, A long winded and tiring approach, but it is needed and there is no real problem. There is no war.

Stories of another incident keeps spreading throughout the fleet, no one knows what to make of it, it looks like something out of Star Trek, A race called the BORG, Ha, as I lye down writing I cannot believe this crap, and someone called Major Jackass... Well, the story is just a story anything to make these boring days pass bye. The story goes that a team on Pluto went missing and no one knows anything since, then stories of attacks and incidents came in. Nothing much we all thought nothing of it and that was the last of the matter.

It makes a good story, and that is all it is, a story, I sometimes feel my life is a story, after all I am on this god dam planet Bane, And my next mission tomorrow is to find some stupid material and take a team with me. I wish there could be some real action.
