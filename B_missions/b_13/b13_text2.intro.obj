Three transports ships will be assigned to you and they are trusting you to escort them to safety. But before that can happen, you will have to pick up some people which will arrive at a point.

Borg space defences currently occupy the arrival point and you will need to clear them first. A HEAVY cruiser the (Victory) will be assigned to you to offer frontal assault power, use this power wisely.

The support ship can restore damage to most of the ships and try and keep it safe, you will not get another one.

Later in the mission you will be given orders to transfer some personal and then escape out of the nebular, these people hold important information and some officers are also accompanying them.

Intelligence shows that there is a high Borg presence in the area so you will have a lot to do, good luck.

But be warned you need to protect at least 1 or 2 of your ships, if they are destroyed then you will fail this mission and will be appointed to a military court for a hearing.
