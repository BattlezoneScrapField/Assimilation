How did you like the surprise of the Mother ship then commander, pretty cool..

The mother ship is the daddy ship that we have to our disposal and it will make a change for the fight with the Borg, at the moment intelligence is tell us that the Borg has moved out of several areas in this latest attack and the ISDF mother ship has been making mincemeat out of the Borg forces.

The scans that have been gathered have shown a rebel faction-plotting agent the ISDF, and even some sources have said that they might be planning with the Borg, but as of yet, we are going to intercept and question them.
