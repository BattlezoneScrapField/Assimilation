This is it lads, we have a small surprise for the Borg scum of this sector or space, but we cannot show them it at the moment.

It looks like they have set-up a small army of gun turrets in the area and they are beginning to be a pain.

It is your job to take them out so we can deploy the little surprise for them.

Also a team of unknown ships are on their way to the area, and we need you to find out what is going on.
