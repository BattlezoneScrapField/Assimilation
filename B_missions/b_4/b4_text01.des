Things are starting to get really serous now, that Ship which looks like a cube and disappeared is what belongs to the race called THE BORG, Mr Wolf did a hefty battle with them a long time ago, before he and his team was lost. We thought that we have seen the last of them. We were wrong.

We are sure that there will be an invasion of earth's space, but we do not know when, and when it does, it will be BIG.

I'm ordering your team to return to earth space, in fear that the Borg ship that disappeared could be heading right for us.

You will meat up with several cruisers and scout ships, your support ship cannot come due to the fact that it will slow you down and make you a big target.

GOD HELP US NOW.
