The heat is really on this time; A Borg cube on its way to earth and is heading at high speed and will hit our defence line first. A team of ships is waiting to intercept the cube and you are to get your team into gear and attack the Borg cube at that location

This is it, it's all down to you, many off our forces are battling the Borg elsewhere but you have all the available units around.

If that Cube reaches earth it is all over.
