We have our selves one hell of a pilot and commander, your work has been sent to the generals at ISDF Command and you are placed in the spotlight, Don't let that go to your head though, a lot of people died in that battle.

We are now getting ready to attack the Borg on there own ground, but it will take some doing, but I am sure with your help and skill, we can smash the Borg back into the stone age.

The war effort on the Borg has stepped up and work on the ISDF Mother ship is coming along nicely. And will soon hit space to mesh up the Borg for good.
