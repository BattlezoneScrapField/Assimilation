Thank you for participating in this test Cameron, although you put up a good fight those space fighters took the hell out of that cruiser and smashed it to bits. The borg are in for trouble now, But we only have the two ships at the moment and the station is split away from the near jump point, so we are alone.

It is a shame that you did not win the battle, but luckily it is only a test and no real harm was done, I guess it was good practice for you.
