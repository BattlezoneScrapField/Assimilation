Thank you for participating in this test Cameron, I am shocked that you managed to disable the two test ships it is unbelievable. Do not worry about the blowing up, we have send teams out to recover what's there, and your weapons have been made to not cause much damage, but give the effect of real combat, we wanted to see how you do.

You have impressed all the people at the space station, you should have seen the crowds of people all at the windows watching the battle, it was a show and it increased moral also… Good Job

The Borg are in for trouble now, But we only have the two ships at the moment and the station is split away from the near jump point, so we are alone.
