The transport failed to reach the damaged EA Pegasus and all hands on board have died, you have failed the mission...

After the reactor blew, a few cargo containing new prototype ships also blew magnifying the blast radius and destroying everything within several light years including you and your base....

Congratulations, YOU ARE DEAD!
