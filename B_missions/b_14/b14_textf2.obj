Major, You just killed all the people on the transport, it will be your job to write the letters to there families back home, and they were needed for the war effort, I sure hope you are smart to replace those good people, because they where needed.

Luckily your previous works have made this mistake light on you, but you will still await punishment for sacrificing thousands of people…. Report to me for disciplinary action.

P.S: - If you had this game on the INSANE Level, then you deserve to loose you PRATT!
