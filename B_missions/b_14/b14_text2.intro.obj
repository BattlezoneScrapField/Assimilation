This is the stage in the mission that you get your hands on a space recycler. Do not let this get to your head, you will only have a small number of units to play with, but space is different than on the ground and we will show you what to do.

But you better get you defence up fast as there is short time for training, as you are still in the heart of Borg space, and they will spot your deployed recycler soon and try to assimilate it.

The scrap system in space is the same as on land, but you need to deploy your scavenger on things called Scrap blobs to gather scrap, I am sure you know what to do once you are there.

Also the EA Pegasus will make her stop at your base, so you need to build a good defence and prepare to intercept it and escort it back. But be warned Borg presence is high.

Your work in your last mission has been outstanding, make this mission count and do not disappoint us; we need a small base in this sector so we can have the upper hand. Good luck and god speed.

Also you can exit your ship when you are close to your recycler, but not to far....
