Level Successful: -

We are sorry to say that after destroying all the bases and taking out the water station, the Borg decided to deal with there most annoying problem, which was you.

Before the base was destroyed a strong signal was sent down the Borg gates and moments after an overwhelming force began to invade the planet. The Borg ships kept on coming like water from a tap.

We managed to get you out of there and back onto the ships. We are retreating our forces and re-evaluating out strategy. 

The Borg has shown us their new power, there new weapon, and that is Numbers.
