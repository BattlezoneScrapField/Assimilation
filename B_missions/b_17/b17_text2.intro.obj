This is the checkpoint of our whole race agenst the Borg; your mission is in several steps. Intelligence has located 3 Mining stations on the planet that is making scrap for the enemy and you are to take them over and protect them.

Unfortulently we are not able to drop you at the base point, so you will have to escort your recycler to the base point and build a base, NOTE:  - The Borg do not know you are there, so keep a low profile.

Devices called Nodes are located on the planet, they seem to control functions and gun towers on the planet, destroying them might shutdown gun towers.

We are not sure what you will get down there and how strong the resistance will be, so we have carried 5 Recyclers with us, so you will have 5 chances to destroy the world, if you loose them all, we are buggered.

Intelligence has located a large water pumping station on the planet that is providing water for the Borg race; you will need to destroy it. Three mining stations are also located on the planet, including one near the base, you are to steal the pods they produce and use them for yourself, do not let the mining station get destroyed, or you will find it harder to get scrap.

Destroy any enemy bases on the planet and take out the gate network.

Auto-tugs will also be available to make, all you need is to build your base up and the Auto Tugs will be made available to you in the recycler menu, they will go and collect pods around the map. They will also convert the Mining stations once they approach them, once this is done, you will have to protect them from the enemy.

This is the enemy home-world in this sector, expect your ass to be kicked badly!!!!
