That was the most impressive work I have ever seen commander, I will send note to the ISDF HQ recommending you a promotion and I am glad to say that you have earned your self the Commanders Gold Star for your bravery and skill to take on the Borg admurder all by your self in that instance.

Your chances down on that planet where next to nothing and how you managed to defeat the Borg will be a mystery and a bookmark for all commanders to come.

Previous scans on the planet showed that they're where no Borg ships and that the Borg Recycler was dead. Those Scientists back at the AAN Made a big mistake in their judgement and I will be filling out a report about them to ISDF HQ.

When that APC blew up, and even now we cannot figure out how that was, anyway our next mission is where you will have to use stealth and secrecy.
