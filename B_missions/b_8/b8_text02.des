Sorry that you had to watch your base die like that, previous scans on the planet showed that they're where no Borg ships and that the Borg Recycler was dead. Those Scientists back at the AAN Made a big mistake in their judgement and I will be filling out a report about them to ISDF HQ.

Glad to see you managed to escape that attack, your base survival percent was pretty low when that APC blew up, and even now we cannot figure out how that was.

A drop ship will be coming to pick you up and the Space Cruiser Lexington will be by shortly to drop you another recycler, this time we are going to give it to them ISDF Stile.
