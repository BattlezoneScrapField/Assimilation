Hole crap man, you just made it out of there alive. When the drop ship took off your base was blasted into the Stone Age,

Your chances down on that planet where next to nothing and we where not surprised that you could not defeat the Borg.

Previous scans on the planet showed that they're where no Borg ships and that the Borg Recycler was dead. Those Scientists back at the AAN Made a big mistake in their judgement and I will be filling out a report about them to ISDF HQ.

When that APC blew up, and even now we cannot figure out how that was, anyway our next mission is where you will have to use stealth and secrecy.

The Space Cruiser Lexington will be by shortly to drop you another recycler, this time we are going to give it to them ISDF Stile.
