This time all is for it, a team of AAN Scientists are on there way to the Borg recycler in a APC to study it secrets to hopefully give us more information on what the Borg are and there plans, but more importantly, how they manage to regenerate there ships and buildings so fast.

It will be up to the commander to make sure these scientists keep to there side of the deal and make sure they get there safely, the commander will be riding in the APC with the scientists.

Scans of the planet are showing not much resistance down there and that the planet appears to be deserted.

This mission should be a walkover for the commander.
