With the gates taken out the Borg are no Longer able to send for reinforcements which means that all we have, is the Borg in this sector of space.

Don't be fooled, they have a large presence in this part of space and they are growing stronger everyday, it is going to be hard to figure out ways to take them down.

The New weapon you were given should help you in your battle with the Borg, with a new plasma based compound the new wire coils in the ships makes this weapon a nasty little thing against the Borg.

After successfully going through the gate to mire you will have to change your battle status back to land, as this war will be fought on mire....
