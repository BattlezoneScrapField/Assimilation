This is it, our first strike against the Borg, during the Borg attack on earth we managed to hack their computer core and get a little information about their race and more importantly how they got here.

Information shows that they got here through a network of gates leading back to there sector of the galaxy, which spells bad news, if the gates where to be up to full power, they could send a hole amarder of ships to earth space. One ship was bad enough; we cannot handle a whole fleet of them.

It is thought that taking out the gates around the asteroid field, they would not be able to get back to there home system and call fore more reinforcements.

To also put it mildly some officers here back at ISDF Headquarters are getting a little jittery and even rumours are weary that some are thinking of given themselves to the Borg, we do not know what this is about, but we will let you know when things get clearer.
