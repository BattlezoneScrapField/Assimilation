This part of the mission leads you to the Urinee Nebula a pink fast area in space with electrical discharge and a possible presence of the rebel ISDF forces.

You and a team will go there and attempt to recover stolen technology from the rebel forces, how this information got stolen is on a "NEED TO KNOW BASES" and you do not need to know.

There is no sign on Borg activity and you should not be hassled by them as the nebular seems to be unimportant to them.

Intelligence shows that there is not much resistance, but the electrical storm is interfering with our scans and several squadrons will be assigned to you.
