A sudden change in plan during the mission left the mother ship to defend her-self and destroy the transport ship and all the information with it.

Intelligence shows that the ship was containing high-ranking leaders of the resistance and they should not pose a threat to the ISDF and its battle with the Borg, nor the Borg will have our technology.

How this rebel faction manage to start under the ISDF and progress this far is not known, but their efforts where in vane, We assume that they were under Borg control and were sent into out planet to gather information about our technology, and with the help from gathering further Borg devices, we have managed to build more powerful and stronger ships.


Many people and good fighters lost their lives in that battle, but this is the battle for the human race and we must do everything to win this war with the Borg.
