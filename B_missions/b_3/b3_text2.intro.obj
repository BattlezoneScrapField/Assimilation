Only got one thing for you pilot, and that is to follow your orders, Space is slightly different than land so if you want to survive and not smash into a asteroid then follow your orders to the letter

This is your basic training, which nothing should go wrong, Be warned, your ISDF Suite does not protect you from space, so jump out of your ship, destroyed or you like to smell the vacuum of space and you are dead. Your ship goes, you go, Understand.

Good
