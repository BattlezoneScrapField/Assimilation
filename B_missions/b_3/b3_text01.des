Ha, It's a never-ending battle for you, how do you attract trouble to your location, even in space. This new race is really starting to piss the generals at ISDF Headquarters; they brought there little fight to space. But who the hell are they?

Hopefully you have the hang of the ISDF Ships and Support ship. 

OK, we got hold of the enemy spacecrafts and found that they are similar to the ones you encountered on bane. Further studies have found out there weapons are more powerful in space, Errrrr, We need to get our guns updated to.

Oh well, that's the end of the report.
