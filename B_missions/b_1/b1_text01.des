Look's like tour joyriding was cut short, A few ships lying around there was captured and we are working on them to determine what the hell they are.

So far, scans are showing that they are fast and have no pilots of any kind, Almost like they are remote controlled or something, 

Hold on, we are getting firing down here, hell Shit, crapppppp......


Transmission ended....
