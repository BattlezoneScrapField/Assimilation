Nothing much to brief about, just that you and a few of your mates are joyriding around in your scouts when strange things start happening. We are sending a Major to shape you lot up.

Your current assignment of finding isotope A56 has been given an upgrade with new orders. Finding element ES52 for plasma creation in the Gun Towers is your new assignment. 
The last known location is in area 576, approximately 1245M from your current location.

Extract this and bring it back to the base. As always, you are to follow your Major and update any new orders you have been given. 
The mineral searching is not important, but it is your orders.
