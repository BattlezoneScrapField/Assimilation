Remember your childhood days where you sneaked out the house to meet your girl, well bring them into practice here.

There is a Borg Recy here and soon a tug carrying a data pod will come through this area which we must have it.  If the enemy succeed in getting this pod, they will be able to build large ships to take you out.

Stealth is also vital, they must not know you are there. They think that they have won by destroying your last base, but we will turn the hand.

Watch out of scouts larking by, they will skirmish home when they see anything strange and alert there base. If that happens they will put the pressure on you...
