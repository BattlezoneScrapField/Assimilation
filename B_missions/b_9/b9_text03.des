General Luxham: to Major Cameron
Cameron!!!!!!, Thought you said you had a excellent commander and I see you gave him the Commanders Gold Star, It is worth crap now!!, I suggest you demote him, or shoot him, when I get there I will...


Cameron: to Commander Jason: - 
I am very disappointed in you commander, after failing miserably the Borg took over that area of mire. I ordered the Cruisers in orbit to drop nukes around the area and kill every living thing, call it a mop up of your failure....

Mission Failed: - Recycler Lost.
