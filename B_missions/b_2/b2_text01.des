Looks like you have the hang of the new scrap collection Idea, normally pods are found near areas where we will drop them or by building that make pods, but you will find it out as you go along. 

Still information is sketchy about the new alien race, scans on the remains of the ships are showing up little, seems that when the ships blow up they take there teck with them.

Well, that's it for planet side, time to meet me in Space, we have a training mission for you to under take.
