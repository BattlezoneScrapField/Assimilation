We gave you 40 seconds to get in a ship, what the hell where you doing, it does not take you all damn day to find a stupid ship and get into it, you are not paid to look around and admire the view.

You have failed this mission in 40 seconds in the game, the fastest time someone has failed.

A replacement pilot has taken your place and is on their way. I hope he can do a better job than you.

Report to the stations officer NOW!

Mission Failed.
