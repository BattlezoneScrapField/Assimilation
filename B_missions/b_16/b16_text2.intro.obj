The original long-range weapons on the space station started to suffer from overheating which would cause a shutdown and leave the station open for attack from ships that could fire a great distance.

Due to this, actions had to be taken, from 08:00 work will start to rebuild and make changes to the weapons to prevent over heating. These works will last for about 5 to 10 minuets the exact time is unknown.

Your assignment is to provide support for the station and fend of any enemy units that wonder close. A team will assist you and you are to use extreme caution. There has been high Borg presence in the area.

We have managed to make a squadron of bombers and they are waiting for your orders, also a group of bombers are on the deck of the space station waiting for you and unmanned.

Once out of the station you will have 40 seconds to find a ship and get into it, there is no time for looking around. Once the space station is back up and running, new orders will be given to you.

Final Note: - 
Some of our ships have gone missing in the area, nothing important, just some drones have wondered too far from the station and disappeared, they probably hit a asteroid or something, but keep an eye out.

Command out.
