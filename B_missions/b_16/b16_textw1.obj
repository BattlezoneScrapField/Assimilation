Congratulations on a job well done, this job was only supposed to last a few hours and you where only expected to defend the station from small common Borg ships and return after the cannons went back on line.

It is becoming apparent now that the Borg managed to construct a Juggernaut ship and where trying to use it to destroy the station. We had intelligence reports of a ship jumping into the area and ordered the ISDF Mother ship to intercept the Juggernaut and destroy it, you have shown great bravery in taking on the Juggernaut by your self and your team assigned to you, but the hull of the ship needed something much bigger to destroy it, but your help in halting its progress gave time for the mother ship to intercept it.

After the battle, transport ships begin to clean up and pick up and survivors, but this is where the BORG infrastructure was found, or base… using the Spy ship you managed to find the base and locate the power supply. The ISDF Mother ship was ordered to destroy the installation and any threat to it. Using your team you done a valiant job in taking out the power and allowing other ships to take out the station, Although the station was build inside the asteroid it took time to destroy it.

We have taken this opportunity to follow the remaining Borg ships back to there world in this area, your next assignment will be to infiltrate there world and kill the network of gates there…

Mission Successful, Job Well done.
