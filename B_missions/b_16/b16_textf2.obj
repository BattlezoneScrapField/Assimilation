You have put up a valiant battle and done your best, but unfortunately the ISDF mother ship was destroyed in that onslaught.

We have managed to get you out of that area but the Borg Juggernaut resumed it course to the space station and destroy it. Our strong hold in this area of space has fallen and recent reports suggest a new gate had opened in the area and the Borg have set-up a new base. All our efforts to look at this base have failed.

It is not long before the Borg start to reclaim the rest of this sector and earth too.

The mother ship and all hands on her have been destroyed.

Mission Failed.
