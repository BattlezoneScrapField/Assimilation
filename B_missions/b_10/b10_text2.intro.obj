Fairly simple mission that should bring you back to your tows commander.

Around this part of the planet is a star port, which you will need to leave the planet. The star port is un-powered so you will need to restore it. 

3 Technicians or Scientists will go to the power generators to convert them on our side, and then once it is done you will have about 5 mins before the star port is active.
