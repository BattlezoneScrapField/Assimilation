Remember this planet, this is where cook got shot through a worm hole end ended up, now it is a holiday vacation place with an easy rout to and from.

Seems the Borg are here, and there presence can be seen by the structures around the place. Places like huts and towers.

OK, after going through the gate the team ended up on mire, it is the commanders job now to establish a base and investigate the buildings and take out the enemy, Sky eye is detecting a large power source emanating from the planet somewhere and you will need to investigate it and destroy it, it is more likely the enemy equivalent of a recycler.

Why are they on Mire?
